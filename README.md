# AirRC

Deep learning pipeline for 3D vascular tree segmentation, built on a
[MONAI](https://monai.io/) `DynUNet` (nnU-Net-style 3D U-Net with deep
supervision) trained with PyTorch Lightning.

## Pipeline overview

```
manifest.json --> manifest.py --> transforms.py --> dataset.py --> train.py --> model.py (DynUNet)
```

- `config.py` — single source of truth for paths, patch geometry, class
  names, and training hyperparameters. Edit this file to change the setup;
  nothing else in the codebase hardcodes these values.
- `manifest.py` — loads the JSON manifest that pairs each image with its
  label and splits it into train/val.
- `transforms.py` — MONAI preprocessing (resampling, intensity
  normalization) and augmentation (random patch cropping, flips, noise)
  pipelines. Modality-agnostic (no CT-specific Hounsfield unit logic).
- `dataset.py` — builds the cached `PersistentDataset`/`DataLoader` objects.
- `model.py` — `DynUNet` construction.
- `config_loss.py` — deep-supervision-weighted Dice+CE loss.
- `train.py` — training entrypoint (single stage).

## Data format

Images and labels are 3D NIfTI (`.nii.gz`) volumes. Labels must use
contiguous integer class indices starting at 0 (0 = background). The number
and meaning of classes is defined by `config.CLASS_NAMES`, e.g.:

```python
CLASS_NAMES = ["background", "vessel"]                  # binary
CLASS_NAMES = ["background", "vein", "artery"]           # multi-class
```

## Manifest

Pairs of image/label files are declared explicitly in a JSON manifest
(file naming conventions are not assumed, since production filenames won't
match any fixed pattern):

```json
[
  {"image": "data/images/case001.nii.gz", "label": "data/labels/case001.nii.gz", "split": "train"},
  {"image": "data/images/case002.nii.gz", "label": "data/labels/case002.nii.gz", "split": "val"}
]
```

Point `config.MANIFEST_PATH` (or the `MANIFEST_PATH` env var) at your
manifest file.

## Running training

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
MANIFEST_PATH=/path/to/manifest.json python train.py
```

Set `DEBUG=1` for a fast, tiny run (few patches, one epoch) to sanity-check
the pipeline before a full training run:

```bash
DEBUG=1 MANIFEST_PATH=manifest.example.json python train.py
```

`manifest.example.json` points at `example_data/` (not tracked in git) and
is only meant for smoke-testing the pipeline mechanics — it reuses a single
volume for both train and val, so it is not a real training run.

## Not included yet

Inference (e.g. sliding-window prediction on a full volume) is not part of
this repo yet. The two-stage training scheme (pretraining + hard-case
fine-tuning) has been set aside in favor of a single training stage; it can
be reintroduced later if needed.
